### 🧠 New Project: Income Classification with KNN [🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/your-KNN-ML-project)
**What I Did**:  
- Cleaned and preprocessed U.S. Census Income data.  
- Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict income bracket.  
- Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib  
**Result**: Achieved **83% accuracy**, with solid recall/precision on minority class.
